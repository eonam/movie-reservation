React + Redux

To do: Cinema App

Description: Create an web application that is a reservation of seat in a cinema.

Goals:

1. Create a list of movies

2. Every movie has different seats

3. Render the seats use an array not rendered via html. (Noe's Comment: I think it is not possible to implement not using html, we need to attach an event to each block of seats for it to process the new state. Please let me know your thought about this :-)... )

|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
|----|----|----|
| a2 | b2 | c2 |
|----|----|----|
| a3 | b3 | c3 |
|----|----|----|

4. When clicking the seat, it will changed the color of the seat.

5. Show the list of not reserved seats and taken seats.

6. Use redux or flux for your data management
